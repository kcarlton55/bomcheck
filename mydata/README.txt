If you haven't already done so, click on the link icon that is located at the
bottom of the file named README.md.  This will open up a live session over the
Internet so that you can try out the bomcheck program.

Load into this folder the Excel files that contain the BOMs that you wish to 
compare.  If it did not open automatically (by clicking the link), open the 
file named bomcheck.ipyb.  An ipyb file, by the way, is what is called a 
Jupyter Notebook.  Once the Notebook is open, you'll see a menu just above the
Notebook.  Go to the menu item named “Run”, and then pick “Run All Cells”.
After a few seconds you will see the results of your BOM check.

If you don’t have any BOMs to compare, and you just want to see how the program
works, then copy into this folder the example BOMs that are located in the 
folder named “exampledata”.

Note that when you move and copy files around, the changes that you make are 
temporary.  So don't worry about messing things up.  After you shut down the
web site, files and folders will be reset to their original state.
