# **bomcheck**


## **WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES**
This program compares Bills of Materials (BOMs).  BOMs from a CAD
(Computer Aided Design) program like SolidWorks are compared to BOMs
from an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) program like SyteLine.  
The CAD and ERP programs must be able to export to excel files 
because that is where bomcheck gathers data from.


## **BOMS ARE COMPARED BASED ON FILE NAMES**
The name of a file containing a BOM from the CAD program has the syntax:
`PartNumberOfBOM_sw.xlsx`.  That is names like 0399-2344-005_sw.xlsx,
093352_sw.xlsx, and 35K2445_sw.xlsx are all legitimate file names. The
names of the files from the ERP program have the same syntax but end
with `_sl.xlsx`. Thus the names will look like 0399-2344-005_sl.xlsx, 
093352_sl.xlsx, and 35K2445_sl.xlsx. The program will match the
0399-2344-005_**sw**.xlsx file to the 0399-2344-005_**sl**.xlsx 
file, and so forth.


## **MULTILEVEL BOMS ALLOWED**
A file can contain a mulilevel BOM, in which case individual BOMs are
extracted from a top level BOM.  For a BOM from the ERP program to be 
recognized as a multilevel BOM, a column named "Level" must exist
that gives the relative level of a subassembly to the main assembly. 
(The name "Level" can be altered with the file bc_config.py.  See info 
below.) The Level column starts out with "0" for the top level assembly,
"1" for part/subassemblies under the main assembly, "2" for a 
part/subassembly under a Level "1" subassembly, and so forth. From the
CAD program, it is similar.  However item nos. indicate the Level, for 
example item nos. like 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.3, 4, etc.,
where item 3 is a subassembly with parts under it.


## **HOW TO RUN BOMCHECK**
To run the program from the command line, run like this:

- `python bomcheck.py`

This assumes that you have the python program running on your system 
(See: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)).
When the above command is run, help info will be shown about required 
command line arguments.  

Another way of running bomcheck is by using the program called Jupyter Notebook.
Enter this in a JupyterLab cell and hit Shift-Enter to run the cell:

- `import bomcheck as bc`
- `bc.bomcheck(arg1, arg2, ...)`

To see the arguments that bomcheck takes, in a Jupyter Notebook cell run:
- `help(bc.bomcheck)`

And third way to run the program is to use the program called bomcheckgui.
It provides a graphical user interface for the bomcheck program.  It can
be stared from a command prompt like this:

- `python bomcheckgui.py`


## **SAMPLE OUTPUT**
Shown below is an example of the result of a BOM comparison that the bomcheck
program outputs:

| assy   | Item   | i | q | d | u | Q_sw | Q_sl | Descripton_sw | Description_sl | U_sw | U_sl |
|--------|--------|---|---|---|---| :-:  | :-:  |---------------|----------------| :-:  | :-:  |
| 730322 | 130031 | X | X | X | X |      |  1   |               | HOUSING        |      |  EA  |
|        | 130039 | X | X | X | X |  1   |      | HOUSING       |                |  EA  |      |
|        | 220978 |   |   |   |   |  1   |  1   | SPUR GEAR     | SPUR GEAR      |  EA  |  EA  |
|        | 275000 |   |   |   |   | 0.35 | 0.35 | TUBE          | TUBE           |  FT  |  FT  |
|        | 380000 |   |   |   |   |  2   |  2   | BEARING       | BEARING        |  EA  |  EA  |   
|        | 441530 |   |   |   |   |  1   |  1   | SHIFT ASSY    | SHIFT ASSY     |  EA  |  EA  |
|        | 799944 |   |   | X |   |  1   |  1   | SHAFT         | AXLE           |  EA  |  EA  |
|        | 877325 |   | X | X |   |  3   |  1   | PLUG          | SQ. HEAD PLUG  |  EA  |  EA  |
|        | 900000 |   |   |   |   | 0.75 | 0.75 | OIL           | OIL            |  GAL |  GAL |
| 441530 | 433255 |   |   |   |   |  1   |  1   | ROD           | ROD            |  EA  |  EA  |
|        | 500000 |   |   |   |   |  1   |  1   | SHIFT FORK    | SHIFT FORK     |  EA  |  EA  |
|        | K34452 |   |   |   |   |  1   |  1   | SPRING PIN    | SPRING PIN     |  EA  |  EA  |

The columns i, q, d, and u show Xs if <span style="color:red">**i**</span>tem,
<span style="color:red">**q**</span>uantity, <span style="color:red">**d**</span>escription,
or <span style="color:red">**u**</span>nit of measure don't match between the two BOMs. Q_sw is
the quantity per the CAD BOM, Q_sl per the ERP BOM, and so forth.  In the example above, 
1309031 is in the  ERP BOM, but not in SolidWorks.  130039 is in the CAD's BOM, but not in
the ERP's BOM.


## **UNITS OF MEASURE**
If a unit of measure (U/M) is not given for a value in the Length column of a SolidWorks' BOM,
then the U/M is assumed to be inches unless explicity specified, e.g. 336.7mm. The program will 
recognize the following abreviations for U/Ms:

`in, inch, ‚Äù, ft, ', feet, foot, yrd, yd, yard, mm, millimeter, cm, centimeter, m, meter, mtr, sqin, sqi, sqft, sqf, sqyd, sqy, sqmm, sqcm, sqm, pint, pt, qt, quart, gal, g, gallon, ltr, l, liter`

When the program is run, values will be converted to the U/M given in the ERP's BOM. 
For example, if the ERP program uses FT as a U/M, then comparison results will be shown
in feet.


## **BC_CONFIG.PY**
Bomcheck has a configuration file available named bc_config.py.  With it the default U/M measure can be switched
from inches to mm or to some other U/M.  Also, column names can be changed, and so forth.
