In this folder are example BOMs that the bomcheck program is able to work with.
If the structure of your BOMs are different (e.g., different column headings),
try to have bomcheck analyze them anyways.  Bomcheck may be able to understand
your BOM's structures.  If not, an error message will be shown.  Have a look at
the file named bomcheck_help.html.  Perhaps it can help you get bomcheck to
work for you.

See the README.txt file that is in the folder "mydata" about running the
bomcheck program using this data.
