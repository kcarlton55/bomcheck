<h2>Introduction:</h2>

    <p>The bomcheck program was originally written to be run from a Command
    Prompt Terminal
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe" target="_blank">(cmd.exe)</a>.
    This program that you are now running, <i>bomcheckgui</i>, is actually a
    wrapper that presents a graphical user interface (gui) for the bomcheck
    program.  That is, bomcheckgui runs the bomcheck program in the background.
    See the work instruction
    <a href="file:///\\DVTFS\Procedures\Engineering\WI-EN-054 BOM Check.docx"
       target="_blank">WI-EN-054 BOM Check.docx</a> for detailed instructions
    about how to operate bomcheck.</p>

<a id="run">
<h2>How to run bomcheckgui:</h2>

    <p>Drag and drop the BOM files that you want to be checked onto the
    central portion of the gui. File names that do not end with _sw.xlsx,
    _sw.csv, sl_xlsx, or sl.csv will be ignored. Files that contain a tilde
    character, ~, will also be ignored.</p>

    <p>Press the green check button icon to run bomcheckgui and have your BOMs
    checked.  An Excel file with results will then be displayed.  The location
    of the results file will be shown in the bottom of the bomcheckgui window
    or in a pop-up window.  The file location will be the same as that of the
    files that were checked.  If checked files come from more than one folder,
    bomcheck will select one of those folders to place the results in.</p>

    <p>If you wish to check other BOM files, push the clear button to clear the
    list of files.  Then drag and drop the new files you want checked.</p>

    <p>If an error occurs when checking your BOMs, or if bomcheck is confused
    about some data that was entered, a pop-up window will be shown with a
    message about the problem.  Otherwise look for something you may have done
    wrong, like failing to attach the _sl or _sw characters to the file name,
    or like attaching the characters _sw to a file name other than that for
    a SolidWorks BOM.</p>

    <p>If at some point in your work day you close the folder that contains
    your BOMs, and later you want to reopen it to make changes, instead of
    having to search for that folder again, click on the folder icon.
    The folder will open.</p>

    <p><b>Tip 1:</b>  Instead of dragging individual file names into the
    bomcheckgui program, you can drag in the folder that contains the files
    that are to be checked.  Then once the program is run, the program's action
    will be to do a bom check of the files in that folder.  The advantage of
    doing it this way is that files in a Microsoft File Explorer window can be
    updated without having to clear previous selections from bomcheckgui and
    then dragging in new ones.
    </p>

    <p><b>Tip 2:</b> If the SyteLine BOM is a multilevel BOM (has a  column
    named "Level"), then the name of the Excel file for that BOM is irrelevant
    as long as it has the <i>_sl</i> characters attached.  Part numbers of
    multilevel SyteLine BOMs are extracted from the BOM data and not from the
    file name.  So then a file name like <i>094433_initial_sl.xlsx</i> will
    work, or even a silly name like <i>ANYNAMEUSA_sl.xlsx</i> will work.<p>

    <p><b>Tip 3:</b> Save yourself some keystrokes: Instead of placing the
    multilevel BOM from SyteLine into the folder that contains the SolidWorks
    BOMs, copy the multilevel SyteLine BOM to the clipboard.  Bomcheck will
    find that BOM in the clipboard and will use it for evaluation.
    (To copy to the clipboard, open up the SyteLine BOM in Excel, click the
    empty cell located to the left of the column header named "A", and then
    do a Ctrl-C.)<p>

<h2>Units of measure:</h2>
    <p> A length value, e.g. 39.54, in a SolidWorks BOM is always considered to
    be in inches. When the BOM check occurs, it is converted to feet because
    the unit of measure in SyteLine is in feet.  However if a unit of measure
    is appended to a value in the SW BOM, for example 39.54mm, 39.54 ft,
    or 39.54', then the appended uom will be taken into account when the value
    is converted to feet.</p>

<a id="settings">
<h2>User personalized settings:</h2>
    <p>When the bomcheck program is run for the first time, a file named
    bc_config.py is created.  It allows the user to change settings for how
    the bomcheck program will operate.  You should never have to make any
    changes to this file. And if you're uncertain about what certain settings
    do (settings are described in the bc_config.py), then don't change them.
    However a couple of settings that might be useful to change are called
    drop and exceptions.  These come into effect when the "ignore 3*-025 SW
    parts" button is activated.  If you want more that just 3*-025 parts
    ignored, then adjust the drop setting.</p>

    <p>bc_config.py is created in a folder in your user directory where
    application data is held.  Look for the file in a location like this:
    C:\users\kcarlton\AppData\Local\bomcheck\bc_config.py.  Of course, instead
    of "kcarlton" you should use your name. </p>

    <p>Any settings that are not correctly typed in may cause the bomcheck
    program to malfunction.  If this is the case, a simple fix for this is to
    delete the bc_config.py that you have modified.  Then when you rerun the
    bomcheck program, the original bc_config.py file will be installed.</p>
