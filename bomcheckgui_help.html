<h2>Introduction:</h2>

    <p>The bomcheck program was originally written to be run from a Command
    Prompt Terminal
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe" target="_blank">(cmd.exe)</a>.
    This program that you are now running, <i>bomcheckgui</i>, is actually a
    wrapper that presents a graphical user interface (gui) for the bomcheck
    program.  That is, bomcheckgui runs the bomcheck program in the background.
    See the work instruction
    <a href="file:///\\DVTFS\Procedures\Engineering\WI-EN-054 BOM Check.docx"
       target="_blank">WI-EN-054 BOM Check.docx</a> for detailed instructions
    about how to operate bomcheck.</p>

<a id="run">
<h2>How to run bomcheckgui:</h2>

    <p>Drag and drop the BOM files that you want to be checked onto the
    central portion of the gui. File names that do not end with _sw.xlsx,
    _sw.csv, sl_xlsx, or sl.csv will be ignored. Files that contain a tilde
    character, ~, will also be ignored.</p>

    <p>Press the green check button icon to run bomcheckgui and have your BOMs
    checked.  An Excel file with results will then be displayed.  The location
    of the results file will be shown in the bottom of the bomcheckgui window
    or in a pop-up window.  The file location will be the same as that of the
    files that were checked.  If checked files come from more than one folder,
    bomcheck will select one of those folders to place the results in.</p>

    <p>If you wish to check other BOM files, push the clear button to clear the
    list of files.  Then drag and drop the new files you want checked.</p>

    <p>If an error occurs when checking your BOMs, or if bomcheck is confused
    about some data that was entered, a pop-up window will be shown with a
    message about the problem.  Otherwise look for something you may have done
    wrong, like failing to attach the _sl or _sw characters to the file name,
    or like attaching the characters _sw to a file name other than that for
    a SolidWorks BOM.</p>

    <p>If at some point in your work day you close the folder that contains
    your BOMs, and later you want to reopen it to make changes, instead of
    having to search for that folder again, click on the folder icon.
    The folder will open.</p>

    <p><b>Tip 1:</b>  Instead of dragging individual file names into the
    bomcheckgui program, you can drag in the folder that contains the files
    that are to be checked.  Then once the program is run, the program's action
    will be to do a bom check of the files in that folder.  The advantage of
    doing it this way is that files in a Microsoft File Explorer window can be
    updated without having to clear previous selections from bomcheckgui and
    then dragging in new ones.
    </p>

    <p><b>Tip 2:</b> If the SyteLine BOM is a multilevel BOM (has a  column
    named "Level"), then the name of the Excel file for that BOM is irrelevant
    as long as it has the <i>_sl</i> characters attached.  Part numbers of
    multilevel SyteLine BOMs are extracted from the BOM data and not from the
    file name.  So then a file name like <i>094433_initial_sl.xlsx</i> will
    work, or even a silly name like <i>ANYNAMEUSA_sl.xlsx</i> will work.<p>

    <p><b>Tip 3:</b> Save yourself some keystrokes: Instead of placing the
    multilevel BOM from SyteLine into the folder that contains the SolidWorks
    BOMs, copy the multilevel SyteLine BOM to the clipboard.  Bomcheck will
    find that BOM in the clipboard and will use it for evaluation.
    (To copy to the clipboard, open up the SyteLine BOM in Excel, click the
    empty cell located to the left of the column header named "A", and then
    do a Ctrl-C.)<p>
