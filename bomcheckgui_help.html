<h2>Introduction:</h2>

    <p>The bomcheck program was originally written to be run from a Command
    Prompt Terminal
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe" target="_blank">(cmd.exe)</a>.
    This program, <i>bomcheckgui</i> that you are running now, is actually a wrapper
    that presents a graphical user interface (gui) for the original bomcheck
    program that it runs that program.  See the work instruction
    <a href="file:///\\DVTFS\Procedures\Engineering\WI-EN-054 BOM Check.docx"
       target="_blank">WI-EN-054 BOM Check.docx</a> for detailed information
    about how the orignal bomcheck works.  This work instruction should be your
    primary source of information about getting bomcheck to work for you.</p>

<a id="run">
<h2>How to run the program:</h2>

    <p>Drag and drop the BOM files that you want to be checked onto the
    central portion of the gui. File names that do not end with _sw.xlsx,
    _sw.csv, sl_xlsx, or sl.csv will be ignored. Files that contain a tilde
    character, ~, will also be ignored.</p>

    <p>Press the green check button.  The bomcheck will then occur.  Then an
    Excel file will be displayed with results.  The location of the results
    file will be shown in the bottom of the bomcheckgui window or in a pop-up.
    window.  The location will be the same as that of the files that were
    checked.  If checked files come from more than one folder, bomcheck
    will select one of those folders to place the results in.</p>

    <p>If you wish to check other BOM files, push the clear button to clear the
    list of files.  Then drag and drop the new files you want checked.</p>

    <p>If an error occurs when checking BOMs, or if bomcheck is confused about
    some data that was entered, a pop-up window will be shown with a message
    about the problem.  Otherwise look for something you may have done wrong,
    like failing to put the _sl or _sw characters in the file name, or
    something like putting the characters _sw in a file name from SyteLine.</p>

<a id="um">
<h2>Units of measure:</h2>
    <p> A length value, e.g. 39.54, in a SolidWorks BOM is always considered to
    be in inches. When the BOM check occurs, it is converted to feet because
    the unit of measure in SyteLine is in feet.  However if a unit of measure
    is appended to a value in the SW BOM, for example 39.54mm, 39.54 ft,
    or 39.54', then the appended uom will be taken into account when the value
    is converted to feet.</p>

<a id="settings">
<h2>User personalized settings:</h2>
    <p>When the bomcheck program is run for the first time, a file named
    bc_config.py is created.  It allows the user to change settings for how
    the bomcheck program will operate.  You should never have to make any
    changes to this file. And if you're uncertain about what certain settings
    do (settings are described in the bc_config.py), then don't change them.
    However a couple of settings that might be useful to change are called
    drop and exceptions.  These come into effect when the "ignore 3*-025 SW
    parts" button is activated.  If you want more that just 3*-025 parts
    ignored, then adjust the drop setting.</p>

    <p>bc_config.py is created in a folder in your user directory where
    application data is held.  Look for the file in a location like this:
    C:\users\kcarlton\AppData\Local\bomcheck\bc_config.py.  Of course, instead
    of "kcarlton" you should use your name. </p>

    <p>Any settings that are not correctly typed in may cause the bomcheck
    program to malfunction.  If this is the case, a simple fix for this is to
    delete the bc_config.py that you have modified.  Then when you rerun the
    bomcheck program, the original bc_config.py file will be installed.</p>
