    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Part nos. from slow moving inventory can be compared with part nos. of your
	  current project in order to look for possible substitutions of parts in order to
	  use up inventory.&nbsp;  File names of BOMs from SolidWorks and SyteLine end with
      _sw.xls (or _sw.csv) and _sl.xlsx respectively.&nbsp;  By adding a third file to the mix ending
      with _sm.xlsx, which contains a BOM of slow moving parts, the comparison can be
      made by clicking the 2nd run button on the menu bar, i.e, the second green triangle icon. 	  

      
    <h2 id="obtaining">Obtaining a slow moving (SM) BOM</h2>
    <p>Go to 
      <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
	  https://app.powerbi.com/</a> then click PC Indiana Dashboards > Inventory
	  (on the left side menu) > Inventory Forecast.&nbsp;  This will lead to a page that looks like
	  this: <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
      <img src="inventory_forecast.png" alt="inventory forecast pic" width=900></div>
	  
	<p>At the upper right is the "View" drop down menu.&nbsp;   From that pick "Actual size".&nbsp; 
	  (If you don't resize to "Actual size", then the "More options" menu is difficult
      to access.)&nbsp; Now go to the "More options" menu (the three dots, ...)   
      and choose "Export data" and "Data with current layout".&nbsp;  Name the
      file you are exporting to anything you want except that the end of the file name must end with "_sm.xlsx",
      for example <i>slowmoving_sm.xlsx</i>.</p>
	  
	<p>For quicker access to this BOM, create a link to it in your web browser.</p>  
      
    <p>To use this file, drag and drop it into the bomcheck program the same way
      that you drag and drop _sw.xls and _sl.xlsx files.</p>
       
       
    <h2 id="menu">Slow moving's menu options</h2>
      <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
      <img src="bomcheck_s_look.png" alt="bomcheck menu options pic" width=900></div>
	
	<p> You'll notice on the top menu bar a number of icons and buttons.&nbsp;  These are:</p>
	
	<ol>
      <li><b>Run bomcheck button:</b>&nbsp; This button runs the bomcheck program.
          (Does not access the _sm BOM.)  It compares sm to sl BOMs.</li>
	  <li><b>Run the slow moving (sm) function:</b>&nbsp; The button runs the comparator that compares
          sw (or sl) BOMs to parts in the slow moving (sm) BOM.</li>
	  <li><b>The X, i.e. clear button:</b>&nbsp; Delete all entries from bomcheck's drag/drop list so 
	      that it can repopulated with other files.</li>
	  <li><b>folder button:</b>&nbsp; Open the last folder used from which files were dragged. </li>
	  <li><b>filter: </b> This is a mask by which you can select what part nos. the comparator compares.
          &nbsp;This filter is examined in more detail on page two.</li>
	  <li><b>% similarity: </b>&nbsp; When the sm comparator is run, you'll see a column named "similar" in the results.
	      The number there indicates the similarity of the text from the sw/sl descriptions to those
		  of the pn descriptions from the sm BOM.&nbsp;  This similarity does not guarantee that the sm 
		  part can replace a part from the sw/sl BOM, but rather allows the user to examine
		  those parts first since they are more likely to be a candidates for alternate parts.&nbsp;  In 
		  the menu's text entry box for <i>% similarity</i> you can enter a number
		  to mask out lesser scoring parts.&nbsp;  For example, if you enter 
		  50, then only scores of 50% and above will show in the results.</li>
	  <li><b>on shelf: </b>&nbsp; In the comparator's results is a column named "on shelf".&nbsp;  
	      This is how long that the part has been on the shelf (days).&nbsp;  If for example 60 
		  is entered, then only parts that have been sitting on the shelf for more that 60 days will
		  be shown.</li>
	  <li><b>switches: </b>&nbsp; Check boxes by which you can filter results even more:
          <ol>
		      <li><b><i>Include "Demand" pns.</b></i>&nbsp;The default is to filter out parts where there is 
			  a Demand for those parts.&nbsp;  <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Only a portion of the parts in inventory may have a demand.</span>  &nbsp; To see if some of these demand parts are available, in SyteLine go to <i>Time phased inventory status.</i></li>   
			  <li><b><i>Include "On Hand" pns.</b></i>&nbsp;The default is to filter out "Qty On Hand" parts that are zero.</li>
			  <li><b><i>Ignore drop list settings. </b></i>Ignore the settings shown at <i>File > Settings > drop list</i></li>
		  </ol>
	  </li>
 	</ol>
	
	<p><i><u>Note:</u> Whenever you hover your mouse over any of these buttons, you'll see a description
	of the button at the bottom of the main window.</i></p>
	
	
	<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
	   <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
	   <img src="settings.png" alt="settings pic" width=450></div>
	   
	<p>If you go to File > Settings, you will find the settings menu shown above.
	
	<ol>
      <li> <b>For pns check if 'Type'≠'Material':</b>&nbsp; In a SyteLine BOM there is a column
	      named "Type".&nbsp;  For a part the value there should be Material.&nbsp;  If it is not, then this part
          does not get ordered.&nbsp;  On occasion on subassemblies that were created many years back
	      a part may have this value set incorrectly.&nbsp;  This is a bug in SyteLine.&nbsp;  When the button
          is checked, bomcheck will look for this bug.&nbsp;  If bomcheck reports this bug then 
          correct the subassembly by entering <i>Material</i> as the type.
      <li><b>Round SW converted lengths to X decimal places:</b>.&nbsp;  SW length values are
          rounded to this many decimal places before they are compared to lengths in a SL BOM.&nbsp;
          Higher values mean that SL length values are expected to have values with equal
          or better accuracy than the SW value.&nbsp;  Otherwise bomcheck will mark the values as nonmatching.	</li>
      <li><b>SolidWorks U/M:</b>&nbsp; Length values at Dekker should be set to inches.&nbsp;  This value is used
	      only when using the bomcheck run fuction.</li>
	  <li><b>SyteLine U/M:</b>&nbsp; Length values at Dekker should be set to feet.&nbsp;  This value is used
	      only when using the bomcheck run fuction.</li>
	  <li><b>drop list:</b>&nbsp; When the sm run function is activated, any items in this list are
          ignored.  &nbsp;Items should be separeated by commas. &nbsp; A star character, *, is a wildcard
          that represents 0 or more of any character.</li>
      <li><b>exceptions list:</b> &nbsp;Exceptions to the drop list.&nbsp;   That is, these part numbers will be
	      included in results.</li>
      <li><b>Projects folders:</b> &nbsp; From the teams folders (<i>VIN UWF US - PCI Sys Fldrs > Documents</i>)
          create links to various folders onto your desktop via <i>Add shortcut to My files</i>.&nbsp;  Enter these
	      folders in this field with each folder separated by commas.&nbsp;  With these
          folders entered (along with the location of the "Engineering Planner.xlsm") when results are exported
	      to Excel, the default folder that appears to the user will be that of the Engineering subfolder of 
	      the system folder.&nbsp; (If the Engineering subfolder is not already created, it will be created.)</li>
	  <li><b>Location of file "Engineering Plannter.xlsm":</b>&nbsp;  Add a link to the time sheets folder EP2
	      onto your computer.&nbsp;  That is, create a link to <i>VIN UWF US - IPC Engineering Group > Documents >
		  General > EP2</i>.  &nbsp; In the field place the location of the file named <i>Engineering Planner.xlsm</i>.
		  &nbsp; This is necessary because the bomcheck program needs to know the CO number associated with
		  a system part number.&nbsp;  The Engineering Planner file contains this number.</li>
	</ol>
	  
	  
	<h2 id="output">Sample output</h2>
	   <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
	   <img src="slowmoving_output.png" alt="sample of output pic" width=900></div>	  
	   
	<p>The first three columns, i.e. PN, DESCRIPTION, and COST come from the
	  SolidWorks and/or SyteLine data.&nbsp;
	  The remainder of the columns are a result of the comparison of this data to
      the sm BOM.</p>
	  
	<p>Blank cells in the first three columns means that the first non-blank
	  cell above a blank cell has the same value as the non-blank cell.</p>  

    <p>The primary column to consider above is the <i>"on shelf"</i> column.&nbsp;  This is the time elapsed 
	  since parts were last delivered and thus they have been on the shelf this number of days.</p>	  
	  

	<h2 id="record">Implementing sm parts substitutions</h2> 

    <p> Once suitable alternate parts from the sm are found, replace the parts in your assembly 
	    and drawing with these substituted parts.&nbsp;  If the substituted parts are significantly 
		higher in cost, verify with a supervisor that the substitution is acceptable.</p>

    <p> In the output from the Slow Moving parts comparison there is a column named <i>alt qty used</i>.
    	&nbsp; There, for the parts you are using as substitutes, enter the number of items you are
		substituting. 
        <ol>
            <li> Export the results to Excel.&nbsp;  Place this sheet in the system folder
        		 under the Engineering subfolder.&nbsp;  (Filename will automatically end with _alts.xlsx)</li>
            <li> If substitute parts were found, to the same folder also export a "short list";
			     &nbsp; i.e. the same report, but only showing rows that have a value in the
				 <i>alt qty used</i> column.
            <li> Copy the short list to the IDEM (Doc-track) folder.</li>
		</ol></p>

    <p> In SyteLine's User Defined section, once the job is complete:
        <ol> 
		    <li> DO NOT populate the "Engineering Reviewed Date" field. </li>
            <li> In the field <i>"Character Field 3"</i> put <i>"Alt Item Check IDM"</i>. 
		</ol></p>
