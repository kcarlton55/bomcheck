    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Parts nos. from slow moving inventory can be compared with part nos. of your
	  current project in order to look for possible substitions of parts in order to
	  use up inventory.&nbsp;  File names of BOMs form SolidWorks and SyteLine end with
      _sw.csv and _sl.xlsx respectively.&nbsp;  By adding a third file to the mix ending
      with _sm.xlsx, which contains a BOM of slow moving parts, the comparison can be
      made by clicking the 2nd run button on the menu bar; i.e, the green triangle icon. 	  

      
    <h2 id="obtaining">Obtaining a slow moving (SM) BOM</h2>
      <p>Go to 
      <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
	  https://app.powerbi.com/</a>, then click PC Indiana Dashboards > Inventory
	  (on the left side menu) > Inventory Forecast.&nbsp;  This will lead to a page looking like
	  this: <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
      <img src="inventory_forecast.png" alt="inventory forecast pic" width=900></div>
	  
	  <p>At the upper right is the "View" drop down menu.&nbsp;   From that pick "Actual size".
	  &nbsp;Next, from the "More options" menu (the three dots, ...), also at the upper right,
	  pick "Export data" and from the menu that pops up choose "Data with current layout".&nbsp; 
	  Save Excel file to the folder of your choice.&nbsp;   Name the file anything you want,
	  except the name should end with "_sm.xlsx".&nbsp;   For example: slowmoving_sm.xlsx.&nbsp;  
	  (If you don't resize to "Actual size", then the "More options" menu is difficult
      to access.) </p>	  
	    
    <h2 id="menu">Menu options</h2>
      <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
      <img src="bomcheck_s_look.png" alt="bomcheck menu options pic" width=900></div>
	
	<p> You'll notice on the top menu bar a number of icons and buttons.  These are:</p>
	
	<ol>
      <li><b>Run bomcheck button:</b>&nbsp; This button runs the bomcheck program in order to compare
          _sw BOMs to _sl BOMs.</li>
	  <li><b>Run comparator button:</b>&nbsp; The button runs the comparator in order to compare
          _sw/_sl BOMs to parts with in the _sm BOM</li>
	  <li><b>The "clear", X, button:</b>&nbsp; Delete all entries from bomcheck's drag/drop list so 
	      that you can repopulate it with other files that you want to examine.</li>
	  <li><b>folder button:</b>&nbsp; Open the last folder you used from which you dragged files from. </li>
	  <li><b>filter: </b> This is a mask by which you can select what part nos. the comparator compares.
          &nbsp;This filter is examined in more detail on page two.</li>
	  <li><b>% similarity: </b>&nbsp; When the comparator is run, you'll see a column named "similar" in the results.
	      The number there indicates the similarity of the text from the sw/sl descriptions to
		  those from the sm BOM.&nbsp;  This similarity does not garantee that the sm 
		  part can replace a part from the sw/sl BOM, but rather allows the user to examine first
		  those parts that are more likely to be alternate part candidates.&nbsp;  You can enter a number
		  in this field to not show lesser scoring parts.&nbsp;  For example, if you enter 
		  50, then only scores of 50% and above will show in the results.</li>
	  <li><b>age: </b>&nbsp; In the comparator's results is a column named "age".  This is how long ago that
	      the part has last been used (days).&nbsp;  If, for example, 60 is entered, then on parts that
		  have been sitting in the warehouse more that 60 days will be shown.</li>
	  <li><b>switches: </b>&nbsp; Check boxes by which you can further filter results.
          <ol>
		      <li><b><i>Include "No Demand" pns.</b></i>&nbsp;The default is to filter out parts where there is a Demand for those parts.</li>   
			  <li><b><i>Include "On Hand" pns.</b></i>&nbsp;The default is to filter out "Qty On Hand" parts that are zero.</li>
			  <li><b><i>Do not show pns listed in the drop list. </b></i>&nbsp;Do not show SW/SL/SM parts listed in the drop list (list is shown in "settings").</li>
		  </ol>
	  </li>
 	</ol>
	
	<p>Note: When you hover the mouse over any of this buttons, you'll see a description
	of the button at the bottom of the main window.</p>
	
	<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
	   <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
	   <img src="settings.png" alt="settings pic" width=450></div>
	   
	<p>If you go to File > Settings, you will find a "drop list" and an
	  "exceptions list".&nbsp; Any part number in the drop list will not appear in
	  results of the comparison of slow moving parts.&nbsp;  In the example above, any
	  part nos. that begin with 10, 24, 25, etc. will not be shown.&nbsp;  These numbers
	  are pump, paint, stickers, etc. part numbers.&nbsp;  Exceptions to the list
	  are in the exceptions list.&nbsp;  For example, 2672 is for VFD electrical 
	  components.</p>
