<h2 id="extract_from_sl">1. Extract BOMs from SyteLine</h2>

<h3 id="single_level_sl">1a. Single level SL BOMs</h3>
  To extract a single level BOM from SyteLine, go to the Item, go to
  <i>Current Materials</i>, right click on the BOM and pick <i>To Excel</i>
  <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
    <img src="BOM_singleLevel_from_SL.png" alt="BOM_singleLevel_SL" width=600>
  </div>

<h3 id="multilevel_sl">1b. Multilevel level SL BOMs (preferred)</h3>
  Extracting a multilevel BOM from SyteLine requires two steps.  First go to
  <i>Indented Current BOM Report</i>, enter the Item no., pick <i>Report
  Option > DataView</i>, then click <i>Preview</i>.
  <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
    <img src="BOM_multilevel_from_SL1.png" alt="BOM_singleLevel_SL1" width=600>
  </div>
  Second, from the window
  that pops up, click the gear icon and then choose <i>Send To > Excel</i>.
  <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
    <img src="BOM_multilevel_from_SL2.png" alt="BOM_singleLevel_SL2" width=600>
  </div>
  <p>It your BOM is empty, you may have to go back to step 1b and click the
  <i>Print Only Zero Level Items</i> button.  Sometimes this button needs to be clicked,
      sometimes not.  Also note that if you accidently clicked one
      of the column headers (Level, Item, Description, etc.) instead of the gear
      icon, your BOM will get sorted and will be useless for a bomcheck.</p>



<h2 id="extract_from_sw">2. Extract BOMs from SolidWorks</h2>

<h3 id="single_level_sw">2a. Single level SW BOMs</h3>
  <p>To extract a single level BOM from SolidWorks, open up the drawing where
  your BOM is located, right click on the BOM, and pick <i>Save As...</i></p>
  <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
    <img src="BOM_single_level_from_SW.png" alt="BOM_singleLevel_SW" width=600>
  </div>

<h3 id="multilevel_sw">2b. Multilevel level SW BOMs (preferred)</h3>
  <p>To extract a multilevel BOM from SolidWorks, open up the assembly model and
  insert a BOM in it.  Make sure the BOM type is <i>Indented, Detailed numbering,
  and Detailed cut list</i>.  I.e. make sure all are activated.  Then right
  click on the BOM and pick <i>Save As...</i></p>
  <div class="container" style="border: 20px solid transparent;">
    <img src="BOM_multilevel_from_SW.png" alt="BOM_singleLevel_SW" width=600>
  </div>



<h2 id="extract_from_sw2">3. More info you need to know about SW multilevel BOMs</h2>
  <p>The advantage of having the entire BOM shown all at once is that you can
  get a broad look at your data.  And if you see errors in the BOM, you can quickly
  pull up a particlar part from that BOM to fix the error.  However with all the data being shown
  at once, it can be a bit confusing; that is, until you get used to it.  Here
  is some information that may help:</p>

<h3 id="choose_sw">3a. You can choose which subassemblies to analyze</h3>
  <p>If you have a large BOM to analyze, you may wish to omit some subassemblies
  from the BOM analysis, not because it will slow bomcheck down too much, but
  because you wish to avoid unnecessary clutter of text that is output.
  To do this go to the BOM and click on it's left side and then click on the three
  arrows that appear on the middle left side of the BOM.  Along side the subassemblies
  you will see + and - signs.  Click on these to expand or colapse subasseblies.
  Collapsed subassemblies will not be analized.</p>

  </div>

<h3 id="missing_descrip_sw">3b. Managing missing part no. descriptions</h3>
  <p>When you first create a SW BOM (step 2b), you may see some part nos. that do not have
  descriptions; i.e. the fields are blank.  In which case it means you forgot to
  enter some part numbers.  Therefore you should pull up the part files and add
  the descripions.  However for welded parts such as bases and brackets, you will
  often see that desriptions are missing.  This has
  to do with how Custom Properties differ between a SW Cutlist and a SW BOM.
  Cutlist items have Custom Properties <i>Part Number</i> and <i>Description</i>
  who's values show in a Cutlist BOM.   SW BOMs on the other hand have
  <i>Part Number</i> and <i>Description1</i> instead.  So if you want
  your weldment descriptions to show in the bomcheck, you need to enter
  a Description1 for those cultlist items with missing descriptions.  However this isn't necessary.
  Unless the weldment templates that generated weldments are incorrect, which
  is highly unlikely, then you need not fill in these values.  So then, you
  should have some confidence that desriptions are correct.  When you
  run bomcheck the empty description field will be filled in with
  <i>----- sw_description_missing -----</i>.</p>


<h3 id="missing_pn_sw">3c. Managing missing part nos</h3>
  <p>Sometimes you'll see missing part numbers that are a result of something
  that was not modeled correctly; e.g. some part in a lower level subassembly
  that should have been "excluded" from the BOM.  You can open up the problem part
  and fix the problem.  This is the best thing to do, but this takes time.
  Another option is to use the step shown in 3a to hide the problem.  Yet
  another option is to do nothing.  If you use the "do nothing" approach,
  when you run bomcheck, missing part numbers will be filled in with PN_MISSING.</p>

  <p>If you don't what to see PN_MISSING in your bomcheck results, you can add
  it to your drop list.  The drop list is discussed in bomcheck's help sections
  1 and 2.</p>
