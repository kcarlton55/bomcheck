    <h2 id="extract_from_sl">1. Copying from CAD</h2>

    <h3 id="CBT_defined">1a. CBT Table defined</h3>

    <p>A CAD BOM Table (CBT) is a table that bomcheck creates internally. It
    is derived from the CAD BOMs.  CBT contains ALL the CAD BOMs, grouped by
    subassemblies. Duplicate part numbers are elimintated from
    the CBT table (that is, those within the same subassembly) and the sums
    of the quantities of the eliminated numbers are added to the quantity of
    the remaining part number.  If a value is found in the CAD's LENGTH column,
    that particular part's U/M is considered NOT to be EA, but some other U/M.
    The default is  IN.  Bomcheck converts these length values to yet another
    U/M.  The default is FT.  The converted value is then mulitplied by the
    CAD's quantity value and the procuct is placed in CBT's quantity column.</p>

    <p>The CBT table, and not the original CAD BOMs, is what is compared to the
    ERP BOMs.  After a CBT subassembly is found that matches a ERP BOM, that
    subassembly is removed from CBT's list of subassemlies.  Whatever remains of
    the CBT will be shown after bomcheck is done with its anlysis.</p>

    <p>If you want to show all your BOMs in CBT format, do not input ERP
    BOMs.  Only input CAD BOMs.</p>

    <h3 id="CBT_sync">1b. CBT is designed to sync with ERP</h3>

    <p>The CBT table is arranged very much like that of the ERP BOM.  This
    makes copying and pasting from the CBT table to the ERP table feasible.
    Otherwise copying and pasting would be impractical.</p>

    <p></u>Note: the order of your columns in your ERP BOM should be like those
    in your CBT BOM.</u>  Then your CBT table will properly sync with the
    ERP table.  This is explained in detail below.</p>








    <h2 id="copy_paste">How to copy & paste from the CAD BOM Table into ERP</h2>
    <p>If bomcheck encounters a CAD BOM for which no ERP was found to compare
    it to, bomcheckgui outputs a "CAD BOM Table" which looks like this:
    </p>

    <p>
    <img src="CAD_BOM_Table_marked.png" alt="CAD BOM Table - example of">
    Image #1, CAD BOM Table.
    </p>













    <p>
    Into the ERP (i.e. SyteLine), after Copying, the result will look like:

    <p>
    <img src="paste_rows_append2.png" alt="ERP BOM - example of">
    Image #2, ERP BOM
    </p>

    <p>Here are steps to take:</p>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Order the columns in SyteLine like those shown in Image #2.  I.e.,
        Operation, WC, Material, Quantity, Description, and U/M.  (Click
        <a href="move_columns.html">here</a> to learn how to do move columns)</li>
        <li>From the CAD BOM Table (see image #1), copy values you want to paste
        (Ctrl+C) from columns Op, WC, Item, and Q</li>
        <li>In SyteLine go to the Current Materials of the Item you wish to paste the
        BOM into.  If the table is empty, click row 1 and then do <i>Edit
        Paste Rows Append</i>.  If the table is not empty and some BOM items
        are already in place, click on the row where you would like your new items
        to be inserted. Press Ctrl+P to paste.  When items are pasted to ERP's BOM, ERP
        will automatically insert Descriptions and U/Ms from its database.)</li>
        <li>Click the Save button</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When you're pasting, if an error message pops up saying <u>Slow Inventory
    Item</u>, or <u>Part doesn't exist</u>, etc., click whatever button in the pop-up menu that will
    allow your paste operation to continue.  You can go back later once the pasting
    is done to make corrections.  If an item doesn't exist that you inserted,
    the pn will be flagged and you will be prevented from saving the BOM you
    just inserted. (Make it easy on yourself.  Preestablish new subassemblies
    and new parts before entering items into the main BOM.)</p>

    <p>If the <u>Op no. is not 10</u> for what you are trying to paste in, you can
    enter a different Op number into the CAD BOM Table.  Enter
    your different number in the Op column next to the subassembly number.  The
    remainder of the Op numbers for that subassembly will automatically change.  Op 15 is shown as
    an examble in Image #1.</p>

    <p>If you mistakenly have the incorrect Op no. in your CAD BOM Table
    and you paste it to ERP, the WC value in ERP will NOT be overwritten with
    <i>PICK</i>.  Instead the WC value will be <u>FAB</u>
    or <u>PAINT</u>, or whatever the WC is for that Op.  You will then know that your
    Op number in incorrect.</p>

    <p>If the <u>Op</u> no. you try to paste in is <u>not already established</u>
    in ERP, the the paste will fail.</p>

    <p>When you copy from the CAD BOM Table and you inappropriately also include
    values from the <u>Description</u> column and/or the <u>U</u> column, bomcheckgui will
    <u>ignore</u> the Description and U values and not copy those values to the clipboard.</p>

    <p>Do not add to the ERP BOM <u>non-inventory bin stock</u>.  (These parts fall
    under ERP's product code no. 810.)  These parts include CS pipe nipples, screws,
    etc.  These part numbers can be made to not show in the CAD BOM Table and therefore won't
    be present when you do your copying and pasting.  To do this use the "drop
    list" when you run bomcheckgui.  (See the "fundamentals" section of bomcheck's help webpages for more
    information about the drop list.)  When using the drop list with bomchechgui,
    go to bomcheckgui's settings section and enter part nos. that are not to show in the
    CAD BOM Table; and click the "Activate drop list" check box.  This box is
    found on the toolbar at the top of bomcheckgui's main window.</p>
