    <h2 id="copy_paste">How to copy & paste from the CAD BOM Table into ERP</h2>
    <p>If bomcheck encounters a CAD BOM for which no ERP was found to compare
    it to, bomcheckgui outputs a "CAD BOM Table" which looks like this:
    </p>

    <p>
    <img src="CAD_BOM_Table_marked.png" alt="CAD BOM Table - example of">
    Image #1, CAD BOM Table.
    </p>

    <p>
    Into the ERP (i.e. SyteLine), after Copying, the result will look like:

    <p>
    <img src="paste_rows_append2.png" alt="ERP BOM - example of">
    Image #2, ERP BOM
    </p>

    <p>Here are steps to take:</p>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Order the columns in SyteLine like those shown in Image #2.  I.e.,
        Operation, WC, Material, Quantity, Description, and U/M.  (Click
        <a href="move_columns.html">here</a> to learn how to do move columns)</li>
        <li>From the CAD BOM Table (see image #1), copy values you want to paste
        (Ctrl+C) from columns Op, WC, Item, and Q</li>
        <li>In SyteLine go to the Current Materials of the Item you wish to paste the
        BOM into.  If the table is empty, click row 1 and then do <i>Edit
        Paste Rows Append</i>.  If the table is not empty and some BOM items
        are already in place, click on the row where you would like your new items
        to be inserted. Press Ctrl+P to paste.  When items are pasted to ERP's BOM, ERP
        will automatically insert Descriptions and U/Ms from its database.)
        <li>Click the Save button</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When you're pasting, if an error message pops up saying <u>Slow Inventory
    Item</u>, or <u>Part doesn't exist</u>, etc., click whatever button in the pop-up menu that will
    allow your paste operation to continue.  You can go back later once the pasting
    is done to make corrections.  If an item doesn't exist that you inserted,
    the pn will be flagged and you will be prevented from saving the BOM you
    just inserted. (Make it easy on yourself.  Preestablish new subassemblies
    and new parts before entering items into the main BOM.)</p>

    <p>If the <u>Op no. is not 10</u> for what you are trying to paste in, you can
    enter a different Op number into the CAD BOM Table.  Enter
    your different number in the Op column next to the subassembly number.  The
    remainder of the Op numbers for that subassembly will automatically change.  Op 15 is shown as
    an examble in Image #1.</p>

    <p>If you mistakenly have the incorrect Op no. in your CAD BOM Table
    and you paste it to ERP, the WC value in ERP will NOT be overwritten with
    <i>PICK</i>.  Instead the WC value will be <u>FAB</u>
    or <u>PAINT</u>, or whatever the WC is for that Op.  You will then know that your
    Op number in incorrect.</p>

    <p>If the <u>Op</u> no. you try to paste in is <u>not already established</u>
    in ERP, the the paste will fail.</p>

    <p>When you copy from the CAD BOM Table and you inappropriately also include
    values from the <u>Description</u> column and/or the U column, bomcheckgui will
    <u>ignore</u> the Description and U values and not copy those values to the clipboard.</p>

    <p>Do not add to the ERP BOM <u>non-inventory bin stock</u>.  These parts fall
    under ERP's product code no. 810.  The parts include CS pipe nipples, screws,
    etc.  These can be made to not show in the CAD BOM Table, and therefore won't
    be present when you do your copying and pasting.  To do this use the "drop
    list".  More information about the drop list can be found in bomcheck's help
    webpage under the "fundamentals" section.  When using the drop list with bomchechgui,
    go to the settings section to enter part nos. that are not to show in the
    CAD BOM Table. And click the "Activate drop list" check box.  This box is
    found on the toolbar at the top of bomcheckgui's main window.</p>
