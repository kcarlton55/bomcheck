        <p id="multilevel"><b>1. Multilevel BOMs. </b> SolidWorks BOMs are sometimes multilevel (subassemblies
            within the main assembly), and the BOMs from SyteLine can be also. Can
            bomcheck handle these? Yes. In fact, a subassembly in a subassembly in a
            subassembly, and so forth, can exist. Bomcheck handles any level of
            subassemblies.</p>

        <p>For a multilevel SolidWorks BOM to work, the Item numbers in the BOM
            must be numbered to indicate the level; e.g. 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2.1, 3.2.2,
            3.2.2.1, 3.2.2.2, 3.3 and so forth. For a multilevel SyteLine BOM to work,
            the BOM must have a column titled <i>Level</i> with values in that column looking
            like 0, 1, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, etc. These formats are standard for
            SolidWorks and Syteline.</p>

        <p id="swnotprocessed"><b>2. SolidWorks BOM not processed.</b> A SolidWorks BOM I
            submitted wasn't compared to a SyteLine BOM. The only thing that happend is
            that the BOM was transformed to look like a BOM from SyteLine. What happened?
            Answer: no SyteLine BOM was found to compare it to the SolidWorks BOM.</p>

        <p id="swnotprocessed2"><b>3. Assembly pn in Syteline, but SolidWorks BOM not
            processed.</b> I have a particular assembly/subassembly BOM entered into
            SyteLine but the bomcheck program reports that that it cannot find the BOM.
            Why? For that particular assembly, the parts of that assembly have not
            been entered yet into SyteLine.</p>

        <p id="slnotprocessed"><b>4. SyteLine BOM not processed.</b> A SyteLine BOM was
            submitted but nothing happened to indicate that the BOM had even been looked
            at. What happened? Answer: bomcheck ignores all BOMs from SyteLine for which
            it can't find a SolidWorks BOM to compare it to.</p>

        <p id="iqdu"><b>5. Empty I Q D U fields (no dashes.. nothing).</b>
            The I, Q, D, and U values that indicate pass/fail results are shown empty
            (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;) for a particular part number.&nbsp;
            Dashes and Xs (‒‒‒‒ or ‒‒X‒, etc.) should be shown.  If this is not the case,
            then it indicates that a part number is repeated in the SyteLine BOM.
            Duplicate part numbers should not be in a SyteLine BOM!</p>

        <p id="length"><b>6. SW's lengths not converted to FT.</b> A part length in SolidWorks
            did not convert of feet in order to compare to a length in SyteLine. Why not?
            If in the CAD check you see that the unit of measure for length is EA when it
            should be FT, it means that the length column is not shown on the SolidWorks BOM.</p>

        <p id="crash_cols"><b>7. Crash... missing columns.</b> Bomcheck crashed complaining
            of missing columns. What went wrong? Answer: several things could have happened.
            A SyteLine BOM may have been mistakenly labeled as as SolidWorks BOM (had
            _sw.xlsx extension). A SolidWorks BOM may have been labeled as a SyteLine BOM
            (had a _sl.xlsx extension). In short, the arrangement of the BOM in the
            Excel sheet is not correct.</p>

        <p id="config_txt"><b>8. Unable to open config.txt (bomcheckgui only)</b>
            The program reports that it cannot open up a file named config.txt. What is that
            about? Answer: Whenever a user makes a settings change (File > Settings),
            bomcheckgui remembers those settings for future use by saving those settings in a
            file named config.txt. That file is located in a user's settings folder. The file is at
            <i>C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\bomcheck\config.txt</i>.
            (The bomcheckgui program automatically creates this file.) Perhaps user
            rights were somehow severed??? Contact the IT manager for help.</p>

        <p id="accuracy"><b>9. What accuracy should lengths be?</b> If you are running
            the bomcheckgui program, at <i>File > Settings</i> the decimal place accuracy
            is set for rounding bomcheck lengths (e.g. .83 ft).  An accuracy of 2 (for feet)
            is a good number. This means that if two places are shown, then the length is
            accurate to within &#177;0.06 inches.  This is close enough. Then if the lengths
            shown in SolidWorks and SyteLine differ by more than &#177;0.06 inches, then
            bomcheck will flag this as an error. Of course, a greater level of accuracy can be
            set.</p>

        <p id="conflict"><b>10. Conflicting column names within the same BOM.</b>
            I have a BOM from my ERP program that contains two different column names, either
            of which could contain part numbers of parts, for example Material and Item.  How
            does bomcheck resolve which column to get part numbers from?  Adjust the bomcheck.cfg
            file.  The name that appears first in the list of potential column names for parts
            will take precedent.</p>

        <p id="wrong_descrip"><b>11. Pn's description in CAD BOM changed after program ran.</b>
            You have two or more parts or part configurations that are configured
            to show the same part number on a CAD BOM.  As an example, two hoses
            with different bends, but with same length and same end fittings
            should report the same part number on a CAD BOM.  But the two hoses
            come from two different CAD solid model files or configurations.
            The two models/configs should, obviously, have the same descriptions
            assigned.  But you may have mistakenly put in different descriptions.
            When the bomcheck program is run, it combines quantities of hoses
            and picks one of the two descriptions to compare to the ERP
            description. Bomcheck could pick the part with the wrong description.
            Bomcheck does not check to see if descriptions are different between
            models or configurations.   That is up to you to catch and correct.</p>

          <p id="no_UM"><b>12. U/M missing for part shown in ERP BOM.</b>
            Someone forgot to enter the U/M into ERP.
          </p>

          <p id="no_sync"><b>13. CAD BOM and ERP BOM seem to not sync at all.</b>
            When you pulled a multilevel BOM from the ERP, you may have mistakenly
            pushed the sort button on the LEVEL column or some other column
            within the ERP's BOM.  The button to sort and to extract an Excel
            file are close together and you mistakenly pushed the sort.
            Close the ERP BOM and derive the BOM again.  Yet another posible
            reason that things are not working out is that you misnamed a _sw.xlsx
            file to a _sl.xlsx file, or vice-versa.
          </p>

          <p id="obsolete"><b>14. PN is in ERP BOM, but doesn't appear in bomcheck results.</b>
            I have a part no. in the CAD BOM, and I have the same PN in the ERP
            BOM, but when I run bomcheck, the PN doesn't appear on the ERP's
            side of the results.  So why in my PN not showing?  In the ERP BOM,
            look for the column named <i>Obsolete Date</i>.  If there is any
            text in that column for a PN, then bomcheck will not use that PN
            when it runs.  To use that PN in your evaluation, erase any text in
            that column for that particular PN.
          </p>

          <p id="UM"><b>15. A unit of measure value did not convert properly.</b>
            In the LENGTH column I put <i>56 SQ. IN.</i>, Bomcheck should convert
            it to square feet.  Right?  Yes, it should, but <i>SQ. IN.</i> is
            not a unit of measure that bomcheck will recognize.  To see units of measure
            that will be recognized, see <i>Units of Measure</i> in bomcheck's
            help section 1.
